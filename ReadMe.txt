This is an automated way of creating plots and summaries. 
For the purpose of clarity we would like to create a directory structure to store out graphical 
plots. We can analyze them all together. 
Please follow the following steps for successful execution of the R scripts and building the project. 

Very Important Tip: Please double check the file path


Step 1: Create a new R project and import/open/copy the following three required scripts in the project:
		1. Model0.R
		2. Model.R
		3. Model2.R

Step 2: Create a folder/directory on your machine/computer, name it Adobe .Insert its path on the first line of
		Model0.R for the variable sp.RootDir. You need to replace your path with the path already 
		mentioned.  Make sure you have used forward slash (/) in the path. Double check the path.

Step 3: Run the entire script of Model0.R. Ignore the warnings if any.

Step 4: Multiple folders inside Adobe have been created

Step 5: Run the entire script of Model1.R. Ignore the warnings if any.

Step 6: Run the entire script of Model2.R. Ignore the warnings if any.

Step 7: Check all the folders and files created.

Step 8: To run 4th script i.e. Model3.R, you need to download the csv attached (CompleDataSetWithForecast.csv) with deliverable or download it from Github.
		Don't rename it. Move the downloaded csv in your R directory

Step 8: We are all set for our analysis now!!!!
